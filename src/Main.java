/**
 * Data Structures Assignment: Hospital Patient Management System
 *
 * In this assignment, you will implement a hospital patient management system
 * that uses two types of heaps (MinHeap and MaxHeap) to efficiently manage patients
 * based on different priority criteria.
 *
 * The system simulates a hospital emergency room where:
 * 1. Patients arrive with a severity score (1-10, where 10 is most severe)
 * 2. Patients also have a wait time (minutes since arrival)
 *
 * You will implement:
 * - A MinHeap to process patients with lowest severity (for routine care)
 * - A MaxHeap to process patients with highest severity (for emergency care)
 * - (Bonus) A priority queue system that can balance between severity and wait time
